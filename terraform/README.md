# Infrastructure as Code with Terraform

This repository contains our infrastructure configuration managed through Terraform. This marks the beginning of our journey to fully automated and version-controlled infrastructure management.

## Why Terraform?

- **Environment Consistency**: Easily replicate infrastructure across different environments (development, QA, production) with minimal effort and maximum consistency
- **Infrastructure Drift Prevention**: Keep infrastructure in sync across all environments by maintaining a single source of truth
- **Safer DevOps Practices**: 
  - Review infrastructure changes through version control
  - Preview changes before applying them (`terraform plan`)
  - Roll back to previous states when needed
- **Documentation as Code**: Infrastructure configuration serves as living documentation
- **Automated Provisioning**: Reduce manual operations and human error

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have [Terraform installed](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)
2. Clone this repository
3. Initialize Terraform:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```
4. Review planned changes:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```
5. Apply changes:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

## Best Practices

- Always review `terraform plan` output before applying changes
- Use workspaces or separate state files for different environments
- Commit all changes to version control
- Use variables and modules to maintain DRY principles
